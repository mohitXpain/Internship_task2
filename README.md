# Internship_task2
Predicting video games sales is a crucial task for game developers, publishers and investors in the game industry. The determination of the sales accurately helps in making decisions regarding marketing strategies, production budgets, etc. Through this model we can predict sales likely for each and every video game.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about video games, including sales in different regions, genre, platform, critic scores, user scores, and more. It was obtained from and contains [number] samples.

# Contents
The project repository includes the following files:

video_game_sales_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
Video_Game_Sales.csv: CSV file containing the raw data used for training and testing the models.
Installation
To run the Jupyter Notebook locally and explore the project, you need to have Python and the required libraries installed. You can install the necessary dependencies using the following command:

# Model Evaluation
We evaluated two regression models, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, for video game sales prediction. Both models showed promising results, with relatively low mean squared error and root mean squared error values, indicating their effectiveness in making predictions. Additionally, the R-squared values demonstrated that a significant proportion of the variance in global sales can be explained by the models.

# Prediction for New Game
Using the best models, we predicted the sales for a new game based on its features. The Random Forest model predicted X global sales units, while the Gradient Boosting model predicted Y global sales units for the new game. These predictions can be valuable in assessing the potential success of the game in the market.

# Conclusion
The developed video game sales prediction models provide a valuable tool for stakeholders in the gaming industry to optimize various aspects of game development and marketing strategies. With continuous improvement and proactive decision-making, stakeholders can improve their competitiveness in the dynamic gaming industry.
